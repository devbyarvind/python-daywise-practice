# 🐍 Python Daily Practice Programs

Welcome to my **Python Learning Journey Repository**!  
This repository contains my daily practice programs written while learning Python fundamentals — covering **variables, data types, typecasting, arithmetic operations, conditional statements, and logical operators**.

---

## 📘 About This Repository
Each Python file contains multiple beginner-level programs designed to build a strong foundation.  
The exercises are short, focused, and demonstrate how basic Python operations work through **real examples**.

## 📅 Day 1 – Python Basics

These programs focus on input/output, typecasting, simple arithmetic, and using built-in functions.

| No. | Program Title | Concept Covered |
|:--:|:-----------------------------|:-----------------------------|
| 1 | Addition of Two Numbers | `input()`, `int()`, `+` operator |
| 2 | Identify Data Type | `type()`, `eval()`, `literal_eval()` |
| 3 | Area of a Rectangle | Float arithmetic, formula usage |
| 4 | Swap Two Variables | Using third variable |
| 5 | Simple Interest Calculation | Formula-based math operation |
| 6 | Float to Integer Conversion | Typecasting |

## 📅 Day 2 – Extended Practice

These programs expand on arithmetic, loops, and dynamic inputs.

| No. | Program Title | Concept Covered |
|:--:|:-----------------------------|:-----------------------------|
| 1 | Addition of Three Numbers | `int()` conversion and addition |
| 2 | Convert Float to Integer | Typecasting demonstration |
| 3 | Swap Two Variables (Without Third Variable) | Tuple unpacking |
| 4 | Percentage Calculation | Average and math formula |
| 5 | Celsius to Fahrenheit | Temperature conversion formula |
| 6 | Average of Two Numbers | Arithmetic mean |
| 7 | Dynamic Average (Any Count) | Loops, accumulation, and division |
| 8 | Area of Circle | π × r² |
| 9 | Volume of Cylinder | π × r² × h |
| 10 | Convert Seconds → Hours, Minutes, Seconds | `//`, `%` operators |
| 11 | Boolean Evaluation (0 and Empty String) | Truthy & Falsy values |
| 12 | Check Value Existence in List | `in` operator and membership test |

## 📅 Day 3 – Comparison & Logical Operators

These programs focus on **decision-making** using comparison and logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) along with `if-elif-else` statements.

| No. | Program Title | Concept Covered |
|:---:|:-----------------------------|:-----------------------------|
| 1 | Compare Two Numbers | Comparison operators: `>`, `<`, `==` |
| 2 | Check Voting Eligibility | `>=`, `<` with condition-based logic |
| 3 | Find Largest Among Three Numbers | Multiple condition checks with `and` |
| 4 | Check Number Between 10 and 50 | Range checking using `and` |
| 5 | Simple Login System | String comparison and logical `and` |
| 6 | Grade System (90+ = A, 80+ = B, etc.) | Nested if-elif conditions |
| 7 | Find the Largest of Four Numbers | Multi-condition comparison |
| 8 | Check if a Number is Positive (and within Range 1–100), Zero, or Negative | Chained conditions |

---

## 📅 Day 4 – Logical Operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)

These programs demonstrate how logical operators combine multiple conditions and help make complex decisions.

| No. | Program Title | Concept Covered |
|:--:|:-----------------------------|:-----------------------------|
| 1 | Check if a Number is Less Than 10 or Greater Than 50 | Use of `or` |
| 2 | Check if a Character Entered by the User is Not a Vowel | Use of `not in` |
| 3 | Check if a Person’s Entered City is Not “Delhi” or “Mumbai” | Logical `not` with list membership |
| 4 | Check if a Student Failed in Any Subject (marks < 33 in any of 3 subjects) | Use of `or` |
| 5 | Check if a Number is Not Divisible by 3 or Not Divisible by 5 | Logical `not` with modulus |
| 6 | Check if a User’s Entered Password is Empty or Too Short (less than 6 characters) | Combination of `or` and `len()` |
| 7 | Check if an Entered Day is Not Saturday or Sunday | Use of `.lower()` with `not in` |

---

## 📅 Day 5 – Conditional Practice (Advanced Logical & Validation Programs)

These programs combine logical, comparison, and string operators to perform real-world validation and eligibility checks.

| No. | Program Title | Concept Covered |
|:--:|:-----------------------------|:-----------------------------|
| 1 | Employee Eligibility Check | `and` with multiple numeric conditions |
| 2 | Discount Eligibility Based on Purchase | `or` condition with user input |
| 3 | Student Grade Validation | Comparison, arithmetic, and `or` |
| 4 | Wi-Fi Connection Check | Nested `if` with string logic |
| 5 | Login Validation | Combination of `and`, `or`, `not` |
| 6 | Check if a Number is a Two-Digit Even Number | Range checking with `and` and modulus |
| 7 | Validate Email Input | String operations: `in`, `not`, `or`, `len()` |
| 8 | Temperature Safety Check | Sequential `if-elif` range validation |
| 9 | Mobile Plan Availability | List membership with `not in` and `or` |
| 10 | Secure Password Validation | String validation with `len()`, `in`, and conditional branching |

- ✅ Using `input()` and understanding string inputs  
- ✅ Typecasting between `str`, `int`, `float`, and `bool`  
- ✅ Using arithmetic, floor division (`//`), and modulus (`%`)  
- ✅ Conditional evaluation (`if`, `elif`, `else`)  
- ✅ Combining conditions using logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)  
- ✅ Checking value ranges and simple validation logic  
- ✅ Understanding truthy/falsy values and membership checks  
- ✅ Handling string validation (email, password, and text conditions)

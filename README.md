# 🐍 Python Daily Practice Programs

Welcome to my **Python Learning Journey Repository**!  
This repository contains my daily practice programs written while learning Python fundamentals — covering **variables, data types, typecasting, arithmetic operations, conditional statements, and logical operators**.

---

## 📘 About This Repository
Each Python file contains multiple beginner-level programs designed to build a strong foundation.  
The exercises are short, focused, and demonstrate how basic Python operations work through **real examples**.

## 📅 Day 1 – Python Basics

These programs focus on input/output, typecasting, simple arithmetic, and using built-in functions.

| No. | Program Title | Concept Covered |
|:--:|:-----------------------------|:-----------------------------|
| 1 | Addition of Two Numbers | `input()`, `int()`, `+` operator |
| 2 | Identify Data Type | `type()`, `eval()`, `literal_eval()` |
| 3 | Area of a Rectangle | Float arithmetic, formula usage |
| 4 | Swap Two Variables | Using third variable |
| 5 | Simple Interest Calculation | Formula-based math operation |
| 6 | Float to Integer Conversion | Typecasting |

## 📅 Day 2 – Extended Practice

These programs expand on arithmetic, loops, and dynamic inputs.

| No. | Program Title | Concept Covered |
|:--:|:-----------------------------|:-----------------------------|
| 1 | Addition of Three Numbers | `int()` conversion and addition |
| 2 | Convert Float to Integer | Typecasting demonstration |
| 3 | Swap Two Variables (Without Third Variable) | Tuple unpacking |
| 4 | Percentage Calculation | Average and math formula |
| 5 | Celsius to Fahrenheit | Temperature conversion formula |
| 6 | Average of Two Numbers | Arithmetic mean |
| 7 | Dynamic Average (Any Count) | Loops, accumulation, and division |
| 8 | Area of Circle | π × r² |
| 9 | Volume of Cylinder | π × r² × h |
| 10 | Convert Seconds → Hours, Minutes, Seconds | `//`, `%` operators |
| 11 | Boolean Evaluation (0 and Empty String) | Truthy & Falsy values |
| 12 | Check Value Existence in List | `in` operator and membership test |

## 📅 Day 3 – Comparison & Logical Operators

These programs focus on **decision-making** using comparison and logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) along with `if-elif-else` statements.

| No. | Program Title | Concept Covered |
|:--:|:-----------------------------|:-----------------------------|
| 1 | Compare Two Numbers | Comparison operators: `>`, `<`, `==` |
| 2 | Check Voting Eligibility | `>=`, `<` with condition-based logic |
| 3 | Find Largest Among Three Numbers | Multiple condition checks with `and` |
| 4 | Check Number Between 10 and 50 | Range checking using `and` |
| 5 | Simple Login System | String comparison and logical `and` |

## 🧠 What I Learned
- ✅ Using `input()` and understanding string inputs  
- ✅ Typecasting between `str`, `int`, `float`, and `bool`  
- ✅ Using arithmetic, floor division (`//`), and modulus (`%`)  
- ✅ Conditional evaluation (`if`, `elif`, `else`)  
- ✅ Combining conditions using logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)  
- ✅ Checking value ranges and simple validation logic  
- ✅ Understanding truthy/falsy values and membership checks
